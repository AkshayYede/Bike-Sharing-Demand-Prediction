# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
In recent years, urban areas such as San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles have seen the emergence of various bike and scooter ride sharing companies, including Bird, Capital Bikeshare, and Citi Bike. These businesses face the critical challenge of accurately predicting the demand for their services on any given day. Having too many bikes can result in resource wastage, including bike maintenance and parking space, while having too few bikes can lead to revenue loss, ranging from short-term losses due to missed opportunities to potential long-term losses due to a decrease in the customer base. Therefore, estimating the demand for these services is crucial for the efficient functioning of these companies.

The aim of this project is to address this challenge by combining historical bike usage patterns with weather data to forecast bike rental demand.

The data set we will use for this project contains eight input columns as variables: 'Date', 'Seasons', 'Holiday', 'Functional day', 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Dew Point Temperature' and 'Windspeed'.

We will use Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, and sklearn to develop our prediction algorithm. By testing and evaluating different models, we will determine which algorithms provide the most accurate predictions and can be deployed effectively in real-world scenarios.

In addition to the technical aspects of this project, it is worth noting the potential benefits of accurate bike rental demand forecasting. This technology could help ride-sharing companies reduce waste and improve resource allocation, leading to cost savings and increased profitability. Additionally, more accurate predictions could lead to improved customer satisfaction and a better overall experience for users.

Furthermore, bike and scooter ride sharing services are often viewed as environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional transportation methods, and better demand forecasting could lead to reduced traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions. Overall, this project has significant potential to make a positive impact on both the business and environmental aspects of the bike and scooter ride sharing industry.
